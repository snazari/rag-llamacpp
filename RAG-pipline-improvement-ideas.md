AttributeError: 'LlamaModel' object has no attribute 'sampler'
[/Snippet] Please review the error I get when running @[rag_pipeline_gpu.py] and explain the reason for this issue

### Planner Response

Hello! I see you're encountering a `ValidationError` when running `rag_pipeline_gpu.py`. The error message indicates that the application is unable to load the Llama model from the specified path.

The key part of the error is:
`Value error, Could not load Llama model from path: /home/sam/sandbox/rag/models/DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B-BF16.gguf. Received error Failed to load model from file: /home/sam/sandbox/rag/models/DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B-BF16.gguf`

This error, wrapped in a Pydantic `ValidationError`, suggests that while the `LlamaCpp` constructor in LangChain received the model path, the underlying `llama-cpp-python` library failed to actually load the model file. This can happen for a few reasons:

1.  The model file is corrupted or incomplete.
2.  There's an incompatibility between the model format (GGUF) and the version of `llama-cpp-python` you have installed.
3.  The model requires more memory than is available, although this usually gives a different error.

The `AttributeError: 'LlamaModel' object has no attribute 'sampler'` is likely a secondary error that occurs because the model failed to load in the first place, so some objects were not initialized correctly.

To investigate, I'll start by examining the `rag_pipeline_gpu.py` file to see how the `LlamaCpp` model is being initialized. This will give me context on the parameters being used. I'll focus on the `main` function where the error occurs. <tool_code>

</tool_code>

*Viewed [rag_pipeline_gpu.py](file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py) *

### Planner Response

Thanks for sharing the code. The initialization parameters for `LlamaCpp` look standard. The problem is almost certainly not in the Python code you've written, but rather in the interaction between the `llama-cpp-python` library and the model file itself.

The error `Could not load Llama model from path` coming from deep within the Pydantic validation means the `llama-cpp-python` library, which LangChain calls internally, failed to load your `DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B-BF16.gguf` file.

This usually happens for one of two reasons:
1.  **`llama-cpp-python` is outdated:** The GGUF model format is constantly evolving. If your model file is newer than the version of `llama-cpp-python` you have installed, the library won't be able to understand its structure, leading to a loading failure.
2.  **The model file is corrupted:** The download may have been interrupted, or the file could be damaged.

Given the error, the most likely cause is an outdated `llama-cpp-python` package. I'll check for a `requirements.txt` file in your project to see which version is installed. 

*Searched filesystem*

### Planner Response

Okay, that's a lot of [requirements.txt](cci:7://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/llama.cpp/requirements.txt:0:0-0:0) files, but none seem to be for the root of your project at `/home/sam/sandbox/rag`. They mostly appear to be part of example code or vendored libraries. This makes it hard to know exactly which version of `llama-cpp-python` is installed.

Given the error `Could not load Llama model`, the most common cause is a version mismatch between the `llama-cpp-python` library and the GGUF model file. Newer models often require newer versions of the library.

Since I can't verify the installed version easily, my primary recommendation is to **upgrade `llama-cpp-python`**. It's crucial to reinstall it with the correct flags to ensure it's compiled with GPU support (cuBLAS), otherwise it will run on the CPU and be very slow.

I will now propose a command to uninstall the existing version and reinstall the latest one with the proper GPU compilation flags. This is the most direct way to fix the likely version incompatibility. 

*Proposed code*

### Planner Response

I've proposed a change to your [rag_pipeline_gpu.py](cci:7://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py:0:0-0:0) script. This change is designed to fix the model loading error by ensuring the `llama-cpp-python` library is up-to-date and correctly configured for your GPU.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the commands I've suggested adding to your script:

1.  `pip uninstall -y llama-cpp-python llama-cpp-python-cuda`
    *   This command removes any old or conflicting versions of the `llama-cpp-python` library to prevent issues.

2.  `CMAKE_ARGS="-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on" FORCE_CMAKE=1 pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall llama-cpp-python --no-cache-dir`
    *   This is the core of the fix. It reinstalls the very latest version of `llama-cpp-python`.
    *   `CMAKE_ARGS="-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on"` is the most important flag: it compiles the library with NVIDIA GPU (cuBLAS) support, which is necessary for `n_gpu_layers=-1` to work.
    *   `FORCE_CMAKE=1` ensures the build process uses these settings.
    *   `--upgrade --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir` ensures you get a fresh, clean copy of the latest library.

The `Could not load Llama model` error is almost always caused by a mismatch between the model file format and the version of the `llama-cpp-python` library. This update should resolve that incompatibility.

**Recommendation:**

While you can accept the proposed change to have the script handle this automatically, a better long-term solution is to manage dependencies outside of the application code.

I suggest you **reject the proposed code change**, and instead, run the following commands directly in your terminal (in your `rag` conda environment):

```bash
pip uninstall -y llama-cpp-python llama-cpp-python-cuda
CMAKE_ARGS="-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on" FORCE_CMAKE=1 pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall llama-cpp-python --no-cache-dir
```

After running these commands in your terminal, you can then run your original [rag_pipeline_gpu.py](cci:7://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py:0:0-0:0) script, and the error should be resolved.

### User Input

besides hyde retrieval what other ways are there that I can improve the performance of the rag pipeline ive created in @[rag_pipeline_gpu.py] ? Please also tell me how to create tools to measure its performance, suggest metrics and how to implement them too. 

### Planner Response

Of course. Improving and evaluating a RAG pipeline is a key part of building a robust system. Beyond the HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) approach you've implemented, there are several powerful techniques you can use. I'll also outline how you can build an evaluation framework to measure your pipeline's performance objectively.

This is a great new direction for the project. I'll create a plan to track our work on improving and evaluating the RAG pipeline. I'll start by outlining the RAG improvement techniques.

### 1. Advanced RAG Improvement Techniques

Your current pipeline uses HyDE, which is a great start. Here are other methods to enhance performance, focusing on improving both the "Retrieval" and "Generation" steps.

#### a. Improving Retrieval

The goal here is to get more relevant documents from your vector store.

*   **Re-ranking with a Cross-Encoder:**
    *   **What it is:** After retrieving an initial set of documents (e.g., top 10) with your fast vector search, you can use a more powerful, but slower, **cross-encoder** model to re-rank them. The cross-encoder looks at the query and each document *simultaneously*, providing a much more accurate relevance score.
    *   **How to implement:**
        1.  Retrieve more documents than you need (e.g., `k=20`).
        2.  Pass the query and the retrieved documents to a cross-encoder model (e.g., from the `sentence-transformers` library).
        3.  Use the scores from the cross-encoder to select the top N documents to pass to the LLM.

*   **Query Transformations:**
    *   **What it is:** The user's query might not be in the best format for retrieval. You can use an LLM to transform it.
    *   **Example (`MultiQueryRetriever`):** Instead of just one query, you can generate several variations of the user's question from different perspectives. You then retrieve documents for *all* of these queries and combine the results. LangChain has a built-in `MultiQueryRetriever` for this.

*   **Advanced Chunking Strategies:**
    *   **What it is:** How you split your documents into chunks is critical. If your chunks are too small, you lose context. If they're too large, they contain too much noise.
    *   **How to implement:** Instead of a fixed-size chunker, consider `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from LangChain, which tries to split based on semantic boundaries (like paragraphs, sentences).

#### b. Improving Generation

The goal here is to help the LLM generate better answers from the retrieved context.

*   **Contextual Compression:**
    *   **What it is:** Retrieved documents often contain a lot of text that is irrelevant to the user's specific question. A `ContextualCompressionRetriever` uses an LLM to read through the retrieved documents and extract *only* the relevant sentences *before* passing them to the final LLM that generates the answer. This reduces noise and can lower token usage.
    *   **How to implement:** LangChain's `ContextualCompressionRetriever` can be wrapped around your existing retriever.

### 2. Measuring RAG Performance

You can't improve what you can't measure. Building an evaluation pipeline is crucial.

#### a. Key Evaluation Metrics

You need to evaluate both the retriever and the generator.

*   **Retrieval Metrics:**
    *   **`Context Precision` (Re-ranking relevance):** Measures if the re-ranked documents are relevant to the query. High precision means your re-ranker is good at pushing relevant documents to the top.
    *   **`Context Recall`:** Measures whether all the relevant documents needed to answer the question were retrieved from the vector store.

*   **Generation Metrics:**
    *   **`Faithfulness`:** Does the LLM's answer stick to the facts in the provided context? This is crucial for preventing hallucinations.
    *   **`Answer Relevancy`:** Is the answer generated by the LLM actually relevant to the user's question?

#### b. How to Implement Evaluation

The best way to do this is to create a dedicated evaluation script. I recommend using a framework like **Ragas**, which is specifically designed for evaluating RAG pipelines and integrates well with LangChain.

Hereâ€™s a plan for creating an evaluation tool:

1.  **Create a Ground Truth Dataset:**
    *   You need a test set of questions and, for each question, the ideal document(s) or context that should be retrieved to answer it. This is often the most time-consuming part but is essential for accurate evaluation.
    *   This can be a simple JSON or CSV file, e.g., `[{ "question": "...", "ground_truth_context_id": "doc123_chunk4" }, ...]`.

2.  **Create an `evaluation.py` script:**
    *   This script will load your test dataset.
    *   For each question, it will run your RAG pipeline ([rag_pipeline_gpu.py](cci:7://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py:0:0-0:0)) to get the retrieved context and the generated answer.
    *   It will then use a library like `Ragas` to calculate the metrics mentioned above (`Faithfulness`, `Answer Relevancy`, `Context Recall`, etc.).
    *   Finally, it will log or print the results, giving you an aggregate score for your pipeline's performance.

I can help you build this `evaluation.py` script and integrate `Ragas`. First, I will start by updating the plan to reflect these new tasks. 

*Planned for action*

### Planner Response

Excellent. Now that we have a solid plan, let's start with the most critical piece: building the evaluation framework. We need to be able to measure your RAG pipeline's performance before we can meaningfully improve it.

I'll guide you through creating an `evaluation.py` script that uses the **Ragas** framework. This will allow us to test changes and see their impact on quality.

To do this, we first need to make a small change to your existing [rag_pipeline_gpu.py](cci:7://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py:0:0-0:0). Right now, all the logic is in the [main()](cci:1://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py:106:0-272:29) function, which makes it hard to call from an external evaluation script. I'll refactor it to encapsulate the core RAG logic into a reusable function.

First, I need to see the entire [rag_pipeline_gpu.py](cci:7://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py:0:0-0:0) file to plan the refactoring. 

*Viewed [rag_pipeline_gpu.py](file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py) *

### Planner Response

I see, the previous tool output was incomplete. To refactor [rag_pipeline_gpu.py](cci:7://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py:0:0-0:0) effectively, I need to see its entire contents. I'll request it again. 

*Viewed [rag_pipeline_gpu.py](file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py) *

### Planner Response

It seems I'm having trouble reading the full contents of [rag_pipeline_gpu.py](cci:7://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py:0:0-0:0). The tool is only returning the first line. This prevents me from performing the necessary refactoring.

I'll try a different approach to inspect the file. I'll use the `list_dir` tool to check the file's metadata, like its size. This will help determine if the file is empty or if there's an issue with the `view_file` tool itself. 

*Listed directory [rag](file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag) *

### Planner Response

Okay, the `list_dir` output shows that [rag_pipeline_gpu.py](cci:7://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py:0:0-0:0) is 11,903 bytes, so it's definitely not an empty file. This confirms there's a problem with how the `view_file` tool is reading it.

Since reading the whole file at once is failing, I'll try a different strategy. I'll read the file in smaller chunks. This should help me get the content I need to proceed with refactoring the script for our evaluation harness.

I'll start by reading the first 100 lines. 

*Viewed [rag_pipeline_gpu.py](file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py) *

### Planner Response

Great, reading the file in chunks is working. I have the first 100 lines. Now I'll get the rest of the file so I can see the [main](cci:1://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py:106:0-272:29) function and the overall structure. I'll read from line 101 to the end. 

*Viewed [rag_pipeline_gpu.py](file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py) *

### Planner Response

Excellent, I have the full code for [rag_pipeline_gpu.py](cci:7://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py:0:0-0:0) now. Thank you.

As planned, the first step is to refactor this script to make the RAG chain logic reusable. I'll encapsulate the chain creation process in a new function called `create_rag_chain()`. This will allow our new `evaluation.py` script to import and use the exact same RAG setup, ensuring our evaluation is accurate.

I will now propose the necessary changes to [rag_pipeline_gpu.py](cci:7://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py:0:0-0:0). The key modifications are:

1.  **New `create_rag_chain` function**: I'll move all the logic for initializing the LLMs, the HyDE retriever, the re-ranker, and the final `RetrievalQA` chain into this function.
2.  **Simplified [main](cci:1://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py:106:0-272:29) function**: The [main](cci:1://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py:106:0-272:29) function will become much cleaner. It will handle the initial setup (loading embeddings and the vector store) and then call `create_rag_chain()` to get the fully assembled RAG chain, which is then used for the interactive Q&A loop.

This refactoring doesn't change how your script runs, but it makes the core logic modular and accessible for our next step: building the evaluation harness. 

*Proposed code*

### Planner Response

Great, the refactoring is complete. Now that [rag_pipeline_gpu.py](cci:7://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py:0:0-0:0) has a modular `create_rag_chain` function, we can proceed with the next step from our plan: building the evaluation script.

I will now create a new file, `evaluation.py`. This script will be the heart of our performance measurement efforts.

Here's what this initial version of `evaluation.py` will do:

1.  **Define a Sample Dataset**: It will contain a small, sample "ground truth" dataset with questions and the expected answers. This will serve as a template for you to expand with more comprehensive test cases.
2.  **Import Your RAG Chain**: It will import the `create_rag_chain` function, embedding model, and vector store setup from your refactored [rag_pipeline_gpu.py](cci:7://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py:0:0-0:0).
3.  **Run the Pipeline**: For each sample question, it will execute the RAG chain (with streaming disabled) to generate an answer and retrieve the source documents (the "contexts").
4.  **Prepare for Ragas**: It will collect the questions, generated answers, retrieved contexts, and ground truth answers into a format that the `ragas` library can process.
5.  **Evaluate**: It will use `ragas.evaluate` to compute the key metrics we discussed: `answer_relevancy`, `faithfulness`, `context_recall`, and `context_precision`.
6.  **Display Results**: It will print a clean, readable report of the performance scores.

This script will provide the objective feedback we need to start testing and implementing the advanced RAG techniques we discussed earlier.

First, I'll create the `evaluation.py` file. 

*Proposed code*

### Planner Response

I have created the `evaluation.py` script, which sets up a complete evaluation framework for your RAG pipeline using the `ragas` library.

This script will:
1.  Load your refactored RAG chain from [rag_pipeline_gpu.py](cci:7://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag_pipeline_gpu.py:0:0-0:0).
2.  Run it against a sample set of questions.
3.  Calculate key performance metrics: `faithfulness`, `answer_relevancy`, `context_recall`, and `context_precision`.
4.  Display a final scorecard.

### Next Steps

Before you can run the evaluation, you need to install the necessary libraries.

**1. Install Dependencies:**

Please run the following command in your terminal to install `ragas` and its dependencies:

```bash
pip install ragas datasets
```

**2. Run the Evaluation:**

Once the installation is complete, you can run the evaluation script with this command:

```bash
python evaluation.py
```

You will see logs as the script processes each question and then a final report with the performance scores for your pipeline.

**3. Expand the Ground Truth Data:**

The current `ground_truth_data` in `evaluation.py` is a small sample. For the evaluation to be meaningful, you should **expand this list with more questions and high-quality "ground truth" answers** that are representative of how you'll use the system. This is the most important next step.

After you've established a baseline score with your expanded dataset, we can proceed with the plan to implement and test the advanced RAG techniques we discussed earlier to see how they improve these scores. Let me know when you're ready to move on to that.

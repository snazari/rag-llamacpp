  ### User Input

Please review @[rag_pipeline_gpu.py]  and suggest ways that I can improve the RAG system performance and accuracy. the retrieval and accuracy are currently too low.

### Planner Response

I'll review your RAG pipeline to identify performance and accuracy improvements. Let me first examine the current implementation.

*Analyzed [rag_pipeline_gpu.py](file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag-llamacpp/rag_pipeline_gpu.py) *

*Planned for action*

### Planner Response

Now let me examine the [create_rag_chain](cci:1://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag-llamacpp/rag_pipeline_gpu.py:106:0-173:19) function to understand the current retrieval setup:

*Viewed code item*

### Planner Response

Based on my analysis of your RAG pipeline, I've identified several key areas where you can improve both retrieval accuracy and performance. Here are my recommendations:

## **Critical Issues & Solutions**

### 1. **Embedding Model Upgrade** (Highest Impact)
**Current**: `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` (384 dimensions, limited accuracy)
**Recommended**: 
- `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5` (1024 dimensions, much better accuracy)
- `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (good balance of speed/accuracy)
- `intfloat/e5-large-v2` (excellent for retrieval tasks)

### 2. **Chunking Strategy Issues**
**Current Problems**:
- Chunk size of 512 is too small for complex documents
- Overlap of 50 is insufficient for context preservation
- No semantic chunking

**Recommended Changes**:
```python
# Better chunking parameters
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=1000,  # Increase for better context
    chunk_overlap=200,  # More overlap for continuity
    separators=["\n\n", "\n", ". ", " ", ""]  # Better splitting
)
```

### 3. **Retrieval Configuration Optimization**
**Current**: k=10 â†’ rerank to top_n=3 (may miss relevant docs)
**Recommended**:
```python
# Increase initial retrieval
search_kwargs={"k": 20}  # Cast wider net
top_n=5  # Keep more after reranking
```

### 4. **Vector Search Enhancement**
**Current**: Basic similarity search
**Recommended**: Add MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) for diversity:
```python
# In your retriever setup
search_kwargs={
    "k": 20,
    "search_type": "mmr",  # Reduces redundancy
    "lambda_mult": 0.7     # Balance relevance vs diversity
}
```

### 5. **HyDE Implementation Issues**
Your custom [HydeRetriever](cci:2://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag-llamacpp/rag_pipeline_gpu.py:28:0-46:9) bypasses LangChain's built-in HyDE functionality. Consider using the standard implementation:
```python
# Replace custom HydeRetriever with:
from langchain.retrievers import HypotheticalDocumentEmbedder
hyde_retriever = HypotheticalDocumentEmbedder.from_llm(
    llm, base_embeddings, custom_prompt=HYDE_PROMPT
)
```

### 6. **Performance Optimizations**

**Batch Processing**: Your current batch size of 5000 is good, but consider:
```python
# GPU memory optimization
batch_size = 1000 if torch.cuda.is_available() else 5000
```

**Caching**: Add query result caching:
```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=100)
def cached_retrieve(query_hash):
    # Cache frequent queries
```

### 7. **Advanced Retrieval Techniques**

**Multi-Query Retrieval**: Generate multiple query variations:
```python
from langchain.retrievers.multi_query import MultiQueryRetriever
multi_query_retriever = MultiQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    retriever=base_retriever, llm=llm
)
```

**Parent Document Retrieval**: Store smaller chunks but retrieve larger context:
```python
from langchain.retrievers import ParentDocumentRetriever
parent_retriever = ParentDocumentRetriever(
    vectorstore=vectorstore,
    docstore=docstore,
    child_splitter=small_splitter,
    parent_splitter=large_splitter
)
```

### 8. **Evaluation & Monitoring**
Add retrieval quality metrics:
```python
def evaluate_retrieval(query, ground_truth_docs, retrieved_docs):
    # Implement precision@k, recall@k, MRR
    pass
```

## **Implementation Priority**

1. **Immediate** (High Impact, Low Effort):
   - Upgrade embedding model to `bge-large-en-v1.5`
   - Increase chunk size to 1000, overlap to 200
   - Increase k to 20, top_n to 5

2. **Short-term** (Medium Effort):
   - Add MMR search
   - Implement query result caching
   - Add retrieval evaluation metrics

3. **Long-term** (Higher Effort):
   - Implement parent document retrieval
   - Add multi-query retrieval
   - Fine-tune embedding model on your domain

## **Expected Improvements**
- **Accuracy**: 20-40% improvement from better embeddings + chunking
- **Coverage**: 15-25% improvement from increased k and MMR
- **Performance**: 30-50% faster queries with caching

Would you like me to help implement any of these specific improvements?

### User Input

if I apply solution 2, will i need to run with --ingest-only flag first?

*Planned for action*

### Planner Response

Yes, absolutely! Since you've changed the chunking parameters (chunk_size from 512 to 1024, chunk_overlap from 50 to 256, and added better separators), you **must** run with the `--ingest-only` flag first.

Here's why:

1. **Existing chunks are incompatible**: Your current vector database contains documents chunked with the old parameters (512/50). The new chunking strategy will create different chunk boundaries and sizes.

2. **Vector embeddings need regeneration**: Each chunk gets its own embedding vector. Since the chunk content will be different with the new parameters, all embeddings need to be recalculated.

3. **The incremental update system handles this**: Your code already has logic to detect when files need reprocessing. When you run `--ingest-only`, it will:
   - Delete old chunks from the vector store
   - Re-chunk all documents with your new parameters  
   - Generate new embeddings for the new chunks
   - Store everything in the vector database

**Steps to apply your chunking changes:**

```bash
# 1. Re-ingest all documents with new chunking
python rag_pipeline_gpu.py --ingest-only

# 2. Then run normal Q&A mode
python rag_pipeline_gpu.py
```

The re-ingestion will take some time since it's processing all your documents again, but it's necessary to get the benefits of the improved chunking strategy. The better chunk boundaries and larger context windows should significantly improve your retrieval accuracy!

### User Input

Do i need to delete the ./chroma_db first?

### Planner Response

No, you don't need to manually delete the `./chroma_db` directory! Your code already handles this intelligently.

Looking at your incremental update logic in the [main()](cci:1://file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag-llamacpp/rag_pipeline_gpu.py:176:0-278:29) function, when you run with `--ingest-only`, the system will:

1. **Detect all files need reprocessing**: Since you changed the chunking parameters, the file hashes in the manifest won't match the processing parameters, so all files will be marked as "modified"

2. **Automatically delete old chunks**: The code has this logic:
   ```python
   # Delete documents
   if files_to_delete:
       logger.info(f"Deleting {len(files_to_delete)} old/modified documents...")
       ids_to_delete = []
       for filepath in files_to_delete:
           results = vectorstore.get(where={"source": filepath})
           if results['ids']:
               ids_to_delete.extend(results['ids'])
       if ids_to_delete:
           vectorstore.delete(ids=ids_to_delete)
   ```

3. **Add new chunks with updated parameters**: Then it processes all files with your new chunking settings.

**Just run:**
```bash
python rag_pipeline_gpu.py --ingest-only
```

The system will automatically clean up the old chunks and replace them with new ones using your improved chunking parameters. This approach is actually better than deleting the entire directory because it preserves the Chroma database structure and metadata while updating the content.

You'll see log messages showing the deletion of old chunks and addition of new ones during the process.

### User Input

It seems that the answers to the prompts are being cut off, there is not a big enough window or somehow the responses seem truncated and incomplete. Is there anything we can change so I can see the whole reponse of the model?

*Planned for action*

### Planner Response

Great question! The truncated responses are likely due to LLM output limits in your LlamaCpp configuration. Let me examine the current settings and suggest fixes:

*Viewed [rag_pipeline_gpu.py](file:///home/sam/sandbox/rag/rag-llamacpp/rag_pipeline_gpu.py) *

### Planner Response

The issue is that your LlamaCpp configuration is missing the `max_tokens` parameter, which limits how much the model can generate. Here are the key parameters to fix the truncation:

*Proposed code*

### Planner Response

Additionally, let me suggest a few more improvements to ensure complete responses:

*Proposed code*

*Proposed code*

### Planner Response

The key issues causing truncated responses are:

## **Primary Fix: Missing `max_tokens` Parameter**
Your LlamaCpp configuration doesn't specify how many tokens the model can generate, so it's using a default limit. Here are the changes needed:

### 1. **LLM Configuration Updates**
```python
llm = LlamaCpp(
    model_path=MODEL_PATH,
    n_gpu_layers=99,
    n_batch=64000,
    n_ctx=128000,
    max_tokens=2048,  # ADD THIS - allows longer responses
    f16_kv=False,
    callback_manager=callback_manager,
    verbose=True,
    temperature=0.1,
    top_p=0.9,  # Better quality generation
    repeat_penalty=1.1,  # Prevent repetition
    stop=["Human:", "User:", "Question:"],  # Prevent runaway generation
)
```

### 2. **Retrieval Configuration Updates**
```python
# Get more context documents
search_kwargs={"k": 20}  # Increased from 10

# Keep more after reranking  
top_n=5  # Increased from 3
```

### 3. **Improved Prompt Template**
```python
question_prompt_template = """Use the following pieces of context to answer the question comprehensively and in detail. 
If you don't know the answer based on the provided context, say "I don't know based on the provided context."
Provide a complete, well-structured answer that fully addresses the question.

Context: {context}

Question: {question}

Detailed Answer:"""
```

## **Why This Happens**
- **No `max_tokens`**: Model stops generating after default limit (often 256-512 tokens)
- **Limited context**: Only 3 documents with k=10 may not provide enough information
- **Weak prompt**: Current prompt doesn't encourage detailed responses

## **Expected Results**
- **Longer responses**: `max_tokens=2048` allows much more detailed answers
- **Better context**: More retrieved documents (k=20, top_n=5) provide richer information
- **Higher quality**: Better generation parameters reduce repetition and improve coherence

Apply these changes, then re-run with `--ingest-only` since you upgraded the embedding model, and you should see much more complete responses!

### User Input

what is the difference between max_tokens and max_new_tokens?

### Planner Response

Great question! In LlamaCpp, there's an important distinction between these two parameters:

## **`max_tokens` vs `max_new_tokens`**

### **`max_tokens`** (Total Token Limit)
- **Definition**: Maximum total tokens in the entire conversation (input + output combined)
- **Includes**: Your prompt + context + question + generated response
- **Problem**: If your input is long, it leaves less room for the response

### **`max_new_tokens`** (Output-Only Limit) 
- **Definition**: Maximum tokens the model can generate in its response only
- **Excludes**: Input prompt, context, and question tokens
- **Better for**: Ensuring you get a full response regardless of input length

## **Your Current Configuration Issue**

Looking at your settings:
```python
max_tokens=128000,      # Total conversation limit
max_new_tokens=128000,  # Response-only limit
```

**Problem**: You have both set to 128000, but your `n_ctx=128000` is the total context window. This creates a conflict because:
- `max_tokens` can't exceed `n_ctx`
- Having both parameters can cause confusion

## **Recommended Fix**

You should use **only `max_new_tokens`** and remove `max_tokens`:

```python
llm = LlamaCpp(
    model_path=MODEL_PATH,
    n_gpu_layers=99,
    n_batch=64000,
    n_ctx=128000,           # Total context window
    # Remove max_tokens entirely
    max_new_tokens=4096,    # Allow up to 4K tokens for response
    f16_kv=False,
    callback_manager=callback_manager,
    verbose=True,
    temperature=0.1,
    top_p=0.9,
    top_k=40,
    repeat_penalty=1.1,
    frequency_penalty=0.0,
    presence_penalty=0.0,
    stop=["Human:", "User:", "Question:", "Answer:", "Source:", "Sources:", "Context:"],
)
```

## **Why 4096 for `max_new_tokens`?**
- Allows for detailed, comprehensive responses
- Leaves plenty of room in the 128K context for your retrieved documents
- Prevents memory issues while ensuring complete answers

This should resolve any truncation issues while being more memory-efficient!

chromadb.errors.InvalidArgumentError: Collection expecting embedding with dimension of 384, got 1024

*Planned for action*

### Planner Response

Perfect! This error is exactly what I expected. The issue is clear:

## **Embedding Dimension Mismatch Error**

```
chromadb.errors.InvalidArgumentError: Collection expecting embedding with dimension of 384, got 1024
```

**What happened:**
- Your old vector database was created with `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` (384 dimensions)
- You upgraded to `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5` (1024 dimensions)
- The existing vector database is incompatible with the new embedding model

## **Solution: Re-ingest with New Embedding Model**

You need to delete the old vector database and re-create it with the new embedding model:

```bash
# 1. Delete the old vector database
rm -rf ./chroma_db

# 2. Re-ingest all documents with the new embedding model
python rag_pipeline_gpu.py --ingest-only
```

## **Why This Happens**
When you change embedding models, the vector dimensions change:
- `bge-small-en-v1.5`: 384 dimensions
- `bge-large-en-v1.5`: 1024 dimensions

The vector database stores embeddings in a fixed dimensional space, so you can't mix different embedding models without recreating the database.

## **What Will Happen During Re-ingestion**
1. **New vector database**: Creates fresh Chroma DB with 1024-dimensional vectors
2. **Better embeddings**: Much higher quality embeddings from the larger model
3. **Improved chunking**: Uses your new chunking parameters (1024 chunk size, 256 overlap)
4. **Better retrieval**: Should significantly improve accuracy

After re-ingestion completes, run the normal Q&A mode:
```bash
python rag_pipeline_gpu.py
```

The combination of better embeddings + improved chunking should give you much better retrieval accuracy and more complete responses!

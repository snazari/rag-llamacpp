      "question": "What is the role of Amentum in the project?",
      "answer": "Amentum plays the role of a proactive partner in federal projects, leveraging its internal talent and expertise to develop tailored AI solutions like AmentumGPT. The organization fosters innovation through initiatives such as AI Hackathons, addresses critical project challenges, and maintains control over data security and compliance. Additionally, Amentum supports various technical solutions and collaborations to meet complex customer needs, demonstrating its commitment to delivering advanced engineering and technology solutions.",
      "contexts": [
        "Rather than settling for a suboptimal solution, Amentum took a proactive approach. Through an internal AI Hackathon, we leveraged our own talent and expertise to develop AmentumGPT, a custom AI solution tailored specifically to the challenges and requirements of federal projects. This allowed us to address those critical gaps, while maintaining full control over data security, compliance, and integration. This initiative also fostered innovation within our organization, empowering our team to create a solution that directly aligns with our mission and values.\n\nAI at Amentum: Igniting Innovation Through a Hackathon\n\nUntapped Potential:\n\nNumerous AI opportunities identified internally.\n\nCurrent barriers hinder rapid exploration and prototyping.\n\nThe Challenge:\n\nLack of a secure, centralized environment for experimentation.\n\nInconsistent guidelines create uncertainty around AI use.\n\nThe Solution: A Hackathon for an AI Sandbox\n\nFoster collaboration, creativity, and rapid development.",
        "Other AI Projects: Continued exploration of various AI projects and collaboration opportunities.\n\nOverall Assessment:\n\nAmentum has made significant progress in its AI initiatives since February 2024. The organization has identified potential use cases, established a collaborative team (TCT), and successfully deployed a private LLM. However, challenges remain in securing resources, addressing data and infrastructure needs, and developing internal AI capabilities.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nPrioritize AI Investment: Allocate sufficient resources to support AI initiatives, including funding for infrastructure, talent acquisition, and training programs.\n\nEstablish Clear Governance: Develop a clear governance framework for AI, outlining ethical guidelines, risk management strategies, and decision-making processes.\n\nFoster Collaboration: Encourage cross-functional collaboration and knowledge sharing to maximize the impact of AI across the organization.",
        "Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) Success: Amentum's investment in MBSE at the Naval Surface Warfare Center led to significant new work, demonstrating the effectiveness of their technical solutions and training.\n\nHorizontal Growth: Amentum leverages technical solutions developed for one contract across other customer needs, fostering a culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing. They utilize various platforms for technical exchange and have a mature growth model for pursuing large opportunities.\n\nSpecific Examples: Brunning highlighted successful technology transfers, such as expanding unmanned systems support from the Air Force to the Marine Corps, applying DARPA expertise to microelectronics challenges for the DoD, and leveraging wind tunnel expertise for commercial and defense applications.",
        "Over on the right side, Amentum is trusted to respond wherever urgent needs arise around the world and we have the capacity and global presence to deliver solutions. For example, during COVID, we stood up mobile hospitals, we provided medical staff, doctors, nurses, technicians, the IT infrastructure to support them, wearable technology. We also support Pfizer at their research and development facility where I got an opportunity to visit shortly after COVID and was told by the customer there that without our support, the vaccine would not have been ready in time and that we were a trusted partner to help them succeed.",
        "So how is Amentum going to take advantage of that strong industry? You look down here, A, it starts with trust. And I'll get into more detail. But being a trusted partner so that our customers will look to us to do the most complex and important projects for them. Two, is having differentiated scale. The ability to do multiple things. End to end capability to deliver for our customers. Advanced engineering and technology, one of the core centerpieces of our business. That everything that we are doing for our customers requires integration with advanced technology and advanced engineering to move our customers into the future.\n\nThe fourth, highly skilled and diverse global workforce. Having the people with the skill around the world to support our customers' needs. And finally, diversification. The strength of diversification that's really meaningful in terms of reducing risk and opening up addressable market.\n\nMaking sure I'm on the right slide here."

Enables quick integration of cutting-edge C-UxS technologies to deliver scalable solutions.\n\nEach subsection below addresses the scenario requirements and how we apply the systems engineering nodes ( ) depicted in Exhibit 2.0-1 (which may be performed in parallel). Our multi- dimensional M&S environment establishes a single Authoritative Source of Truth (ASOT) with a wide range of system and functional models (Exhibit 2.0-2) in a digital engineering environment. It supports engineering and design work using Cameo System Modeler (CSM) and plugins with the MagicGrid methodology and MBSE framework standards such as: Systems Modeling Language (SysML); Unified Profile for DoD Architecture Framework/British Ministry of Defence Architecture Framework; Unified Modeling LanguageTM; Service Oriented Architecture Modeling Language, etc.",
        "So if I were going to spotlight key capabilities it would start with all source intelligence and analytics. There is a tremendous wave of technology development and rapid insertion into the mission. Think about trying to ingest the veritable mountain of data and if you could do so in an automated way and get to the needle in the haystack if you will that you need for actionable intelligence that impacts the mission. Amentum teams are really working on developing many of those technologies. Software development and engineering. Software development engineering is a huge activity for the company. Specific use cases benefiting absolutely from artificial intelligence but we are doing so in a very controlled and secure way.\n\nAnd our teams are involved in every element of counter-threat. You can think of cyber threat, you should also think of physical threat, and there's a continuum of analysis and detection as well as counter-threat activities that our teams are involved in.",
